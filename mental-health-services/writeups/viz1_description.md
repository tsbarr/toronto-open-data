# Toronto's Mental Health Landscape: Service Distribution and Crisis Response Patterns

This interactive visualization explores the spatial relationship between mental health services and crisis interventions across Toronto neighborhoods, revealing crucial patterns in urban healthcare accessibility.

## Key Insights
- **Service Distribution**: The map reveals concentrated mental health services in downtown areas (particularly the Church-Yonge Corridor), with notably fewer resources in outer regions
- **Crisis Response Patterns**: Areas with higher apprehension counts (darker blue) don't always align with service availability, suggesting potential gaps in coverage
- **Service Type Mix**: The distinction between general Mental Health Services (purple) and Concurrent Disorder Programs (yellow) shows specialized care clustering

## Technical Implementation
Built using Tableau Public, this visualization combines:
- Choropleth mapping techniques for apprehension density
- Point-based service location mapping with categorical color coding
- Interactive filtering by year (2014-2024) for temporal analysis
- Custom binning for apprehension counts (170-3,042)

## Analysis Features
Users can:
- Explore the relationship between service count and apprehension frequency
- Filter data by year to observe temporal patterns
- Distinguish between service types to assess specialized care distribution
- Identify potential service gaps by comparing service density with need indicators

## Data Sources
- Mental Health Act Apprehensions (2014-2024)
- Toronto Mental Health Services Directory
- Toronto Neighborhood Boundary Data
