# Toronto Open Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains analyses of various public datasets from the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/). Each analysis explores different aspects of urban life and city services, combining data science techniques with a focus on community impact.

## Motivation
As a data scientist transitioning from evolutionary biology research, I'm fascinated by patterns in urban systems just as I once studied patterns in natural systems. Cities generate rich datasets that can help us understand and improve urban life. Toronto, my home city, provides extensive open data that enables evidence-based insights into how our city works and how we might make it better.

## Projects

### ðŸš¢ [Ferry Service Analysis](./islands-ferry)
Analyzing patterns in Toronto Island Ferry usage to understand:
